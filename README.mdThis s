# ERP System Project Structure

This ERP system follows a modular structure for better maintainability and scalability.

## Directory Structure

/assets` - Static files (CSS, JS, Images)
/config` - Configuration and Database scripts
/includes` - Shared components and helper functions
/modules` - Core business modules
/sql` - Database migration and backup storage
  - `/css` - Styling files (style.css)
  - `/js` - Frontend logic (main.js)
  - `/images` - Product and profile images
  - `db.php` - Database connection using PDO
  - `database.sql` - SQL script to initialize the database
  - `header.php` - Sidebar and navigation
  - `footer.php` - Layout footer and scripts
  - `functions.php` - Common utility functions
  - `/inventory` - Product and stock management
  - `/sales` - Customer orders and sales tracking
  - `/purchases` - Supplier orders and stock intake
  - `/customers` - CRM and customer profiles
  - `/suppliers` - Vendor management
  - `/hr` - Employee management and payroll
  - `/finance` - Accounting, income, and expenses
  - `/reports` - Analytics and business intelligence
- `index.php` - Main Dashboard
- `login.php` - Authentication page
- `logout.php` - Session termination

## Coding Standards

- Use **PDO** for all database interactions to prevent SQL injection.
- Modularize logic into the `/modules` directory.
- Keep UI consistent using the global `style.css` and Lucide icons.
- Add helper functions to `includes/functions.php`.



# ERP System Definition

## 1. Project Overview
The **ERP System** is a modular web-based application designed to manage core business processes, including inventory, sales, purchases, human resources, and finance. It aims to provide a centralized platform for data-driven decision-making and efficient resource management.

## 2. Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3 (Vanilla), Vanilla JavaScript
- **Backend**: PHP (Core)
- **Database**: MySQL (PDO for Secure Connection)
- **Icons**: Lucide Icons
- **Fonts**: Inter (Google Fonts)

## 3. Core Modules
### 3.1 Dashboard
- Real-time business overview.
- Key performance indicators (KPIs) like total sales, stock levels, and active customers.
- Low stock alerts and recent transaction summaries.

### 3.2 Inventory Management
- Product catalog management (Add, Edit, Delete).
- Stock level tracking.
- Category-based organization.

### 3.3 Sales & CRM
- Customer database management.
- Sales order processing.
- Revenue tracking and history.

### 3.4 Purchasing & Supply Chain
- Supplier management.
- Purchase order creation and tracking.
- Stock replenishment logic.

### 3.5 Human Resources (HR)
- Employee records and profiles.
- Role-based access control (Admin, Manager, Staff).

### 3.6 Finance & Accounting
- Expense tracking.
- Income statements and basic financial reporting.

### 3.7 Reports & Analytics
- Visual data representation.
- Exportable business reports (PDF/Excel).

## 4. System Architecture
The system follows a **Modular Monolith** architecture:
- **Presentation Layer**: PHP files generating HTML with shared `header.php` and `footer.php`.
- **Logic Layer**: Modularized business logic within the `/modules` directory.
- **Data Access Layer**: Centrally managed PDO connection in `config/db.php`.

## 5. Security & Authentication
- Session-based authentication.
- Password hashing using `password_hash()` (BCRYPT).
- Input sanitization to prevent XSS.
- Prepared statements (PDO) to prevent SQL Injection.
- Role-based permissions for sensitive operations.

## 6. Development Workflow
1. **Database First**: Define schema in `config/database.sql`.
2. **Modular Development**: Create module-specific logic in `/modules`.
3. **Consistent UI**: Utilize global `assets/css/style.css` for all components.
4. **Utility Functions**: Place reusable logic in `includes/functions.php`.
